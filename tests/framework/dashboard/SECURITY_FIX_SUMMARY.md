# Memory Allocation Vulnerability Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed a critical memory allocation vulnerability in `tests/framework/dashboard/metrics_aggregator.go` at line 746 where the `GetMetricsHistory` function could be exploited for memory exhaustion attacks through unbounded slice allocation.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Location**: `tests/framework/dashboard/metrics_aggregator.go:746`
- **Issue**: `make([]*TestMetrics, limit)` created slices with user-controlled size without proper bounds checking
- **Attack Vector**: DoS attacks via memory exhaustion by providing extremely large `limit` values
- **Severity**: High - could cause service unavailability

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Security Constants
```go
const (
    MaxHistoryLimit         = 1000   // Recommended maximum for normal operations
    AbsoluteMaxHistoryLimit = 10000  // Hard upper bound to prevent DoS
    DefaultHistoryLimit     = 100    // Safe default when no/invalid limit provided
)
```

### 2. Input Validation Function
- **Function**: `validateHistoryLimit(limit int, availableHistory int) int`
- **Features**:
  - Handles negative and zero limits safely
  - Enforces absolute maximum to prevent DoS attacks
  - Logs security warnings for suspicious requests
  - Caps requests to available data size

### 3. Enhanced GetMetricsHistory Function
- **Comprehensive bounds checking**: All user input is validated before allocation
- **Memory-safe allocation**: Slice size is guaranteed to be within safe bounds
- **Graceful degradation**: Large requests are capped rather than rejected
- **Attack logging**: Suspicious activity is logged for security monitoring

### 4. Configuration Validation
- **Function**: `validateAggregatorConfig(config *AggregatorConfig) error`
- **Features**:
  - Validates `MaxHistorySize` configuration values
  - Prevents path traversal attacks in output directory
  - Sanitizes dangerous configuration values
  - Auto-corrects invalid settings to safe defaults

## Attack Scenarios Tested

### 1. Memory Exhaustion Attacks
- ✅ Small DoS attempt (100K limit) → Capped to available data
- ✅ Large DoS attempt (1M limit) → Capped to available data
- ✅ Extreme DoS attempt (1B limit) → Capped to available data
- ✅ Integer overflow attempt (MaxInt32) → Capped to available data

### 2. Edge Case Attacks
- ✅ Negative limits → Default to safe values
- ✅ Zero limits → Default to safe values
- ✅ Gradual escalation → Each request properly bounded
- ✅ Repeated maximum requests → Consistently capped

### 3. Configuration Attacks
- ✅ Path traversal in output directory → Blocked with error
- ✅ Excessive MaxHistorySize → Auto-corrected to safe values
- ✅ Invalid configuration values → Sanitized to defaults

## Performance Impact
- **Normal operations**: No performance impact (microsecond validation overhead)
- **Under attack**: Maintains consistent performance even with malicious requests
- **Memory usage**: Bounded to safe limits regardless of input

## Security Benefits
1. **DoS Prevention**: Impossible to exhaust memory through this vector
2. **Attack Detection**: Suspicious requests are logged for monitoring
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Service remains available during attacks
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers prevent bypass
5. **Configuration Safety**: Prevents misconfiguration-based vulnerabilities

## Testing Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for all validation functions
- ✅ Memory exhaustion attack simulations
- ✅ Real-world attack scenario testing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks under attack
- ✅ Configuration validation testing
- ✅ Edge case and boundary testing
