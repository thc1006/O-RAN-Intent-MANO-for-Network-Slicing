## Executive Overview

The O-RAN Intent-MANO for Network Slicing project successfully completed a strategic version compatibility migration to resolve critical CI/CD pipeline failures and ensure development environment stability. This executive summary outlines the key decisions, impacts, and business implications of the version changes implemented across the project's multi-service architecture.

---

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
- **Critical Issue**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline failures preventing deployments
- **Root Cause**: Go version incompatibilities across modules and dependencies
- **Business Impact**: Blocked development workflow, delayed feature releases
- **Risk Level**: High - production deployment pipeline compromised

### Strategic Response
A comprehensive version alignment strategy was implemented to:
1. Restore CI/CD pipeline functionality
2. Maintain production service capabilities
3. Preserve development velocity
4. Establish sustainable version management

---

## Migration Overview

### Scope of Changes
- **Modules Affected**: 9 primary modules across the microservices architecture
- **Version Range**: Go 1.22 - Go 1.24.7 with strategic distribution
- **Dependencies Updated**: 50+ critical dependencies realigned
- **Infrastructure**: Docker images, CI/CD workflows, and development environments

### Strategic Approach
The migration employed a **mixed-version strategy** rather than a uniform downgrade:
- **Stability-First**: Core services standardized on Go 1.22
- **Feature-Preservation**: Advanced services maintained on Go 1.24+
- **Gradual Migration**: Phased approach to minimize service disruption

---

## Key Decisions and Rationale

### 1. Multi-Version Strategy
**Decision**: Implement different Go versions across services
**Rationale**:
- Balances stability needs with feature requirements
- Minimizes service disruption during migration
- Allows gradual unification over time

| Service Category | Go Version | Strategic Purpose |
|------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Core Services** | 1.22 | Maximum stability and CI/CD compatibility |
| **Advanced Services** | 1.24+ | Preserve cutting-edge features and performance |
| **Transitional Services** | Mixed | Gradual migration path |

### 2. Dependency Management
**Decision**: Strategic downgrades with security preservation
**Rationale**:
- Ensures version compatibility
- Maintains security posture
- Provides upgrade pathway

**Key Downgrades**:
- Kubernetes APIs: v0.34.1 ‚Üí v0.29.4 (TN module only)
- Web Frameworks: v1.11.0 ‚Üí v1.9.1 (selected modules)
- Monitoring: v1.23.2 ‚Üí v1.19.1 (constrained modules)

### 3. Infrastructure Alignment
**Decision**: Docker and CI/CD environment standardization
**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent build environments
- Prevents runtime compatibility issues
- Simplifies deployment procedures
