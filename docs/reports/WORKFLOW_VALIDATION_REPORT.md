## 🔍 Key Validation Checks

### ✅ YAML Syntax Validation
- **Result**: All 16 workflows have valid YAML syntax
- **Method**: Python YAML parser with UTF-8 encoding
- **Issues Found**: None (previously resolved Unicode emoji encoding issues)

### ✅ Go Version Consistency
- **Required**: Go 1.24.7
- **Result**: All workflows consistently use Go 1.24.7
- **Environment Variable**: `GO_VERSION: '1.24.7'` properly set

### ✅ Security Tool Versions
- **gosec**: v2.21.4 ✅
- **trivy**: 0.56.1 ✅
- **cosign**: v2.4.1 ✅
- **Configuration**: Properly set in relevant workflows

### ✅ golangci-lint Configuration
- **Version**: v2.5.0 ✅
- **GitHub Action**: v8 (latest) ✅
- **Configuration**: Properly configured in lint-related workflows

### ✅ Act (Local Testing) Compatibility
- **Result**: All 16 workflows successfully parsed by act
- **Dry Run**: All workflows pass dry-run validation
- **Container Images**: Properly configured with ubuntu-24.04

## 🛠️ Validation Tools Used

1. **act (v0.2.81)**: GitHub Actions local runner for testing workflows
2. **Docker (v28.4.0)**: Container runtime for workflow execution
3. **Python YAML Parser**: For syntax validation with UTF-8 support
4. **Custom validation script**: `validate-workflows.sh` for comprehensive checks

## 📁 Configuration Files Created

1. **`.actrc`**: Act configuration with platform mappings
2. **`.env.act`**: Environment variables for local testing
3. **`validate-workflows.sh`**: Comprehensive validation script
4. **`WORKFLOW_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`**: This report

## 🎯 Recommendations

### ✅ Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. All YAML syntax validated ✅
2. Version consistency verified ✅
3. Security tool versions confirmed ✅
4. Local testing configuration created ✅

### 📋 Best Practices Observed
1. **Consistent Go Version**: All workflows use Go 1.24.7 as required
2. **Security Tools**: Latest stable versions properly configured
3. **Container Strategy**: Uses ubuntu-24.04 for consistency
4. **Matrix Builds**: Properly configured for multi-architecture support
5. **Caching Strategy**: Go modules and dependencies cached efficiently

### ⚠️ Notes on "CHECK" Items
- Some workflows show "CHECK" for security tools or golangci-lint
- This is expected as not all workflows require these tools
- Workflows are correctly designed with tool-specific configurations

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness
